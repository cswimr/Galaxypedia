# Overview

Over the years, Galaxy\'s community and staff have made some great art for the game. This includes images, videos, [music](music "wikilink"), and more. This page serves as a gallery of visual art (for audio, see [Music](Music "wikilink")). This page is largely maintained by [Glowstone_Guy](https://galaxypedia.org/wiki/User:Glowstone_Guy), but if you have art to submit, please feel free to add it to the page, or ask a [Galaxypedia Staff Member](https://discord.galaxypedia.org) for assistance if you\'re not sure how.

# Thumbnails and Loading Screens {#thumbnails_and_loading_screens}

This section covers art used in the game\'s thumbnail, loading screens, or the banner for the [Discord server](https://galaxy.robloxgalaxy.wiki/).

<File:BattleThumbnail001.png%7Cthumb>\|**Creator: Andrew Colunga** - This image is used as a loading screen for the game. It features older models of a [Deity](Deity "wikilink"), [Leviathan](Leviathan "wikilink"), [Nemesis](Nemesis "wikilink"), [Sixfold](Sixfold "wikilink"), and more. <File:BattleThumbnail002.png%7Cthumb>\|**Creator: Andrew Colunga** - This image is similar to that of the other loading screen, but with the Deity swapped out for a [Prototype X-1](Prototype_X-1 "wikilink"), and an unknown ship swapped with a [Ridgebreaker](Ridgebreaker "wikilink"). It is used as a loading screen. <File:UpdatedThumbnail001.png%7Cthumb>\|**Creators: Andrew Colunga, Sean Morabito** - This is an updated version of the first image listed. It serves as a loading screen for the game. <File:UNEBanner001.png%7Cthumb>\|**Creator: SmolTactician** - This is an image of a [UNE](UNE "wikilink") fleet in battle, with a [Prototype X-1](Prototype_X-1 "wikilink"), a [Zhanado](Zhanado "wikilink"), and multiple [Chimeras](Chimera "wikilink"). It is currently used as a loading screen. <File:ViperThumbnail001.png%7Cthumb%7C3200px>\|**Creator: _Unknown_** - An old loading screen which featured a blueprint of a [Viper](Viper "wikilink"). Some players allegedly still see this image, which is most likely a bug. <File:FleetThumbnail001.png%7Cthumb>\|**Creator: _Unknown_** - This image shows a few concept ships flying into the distance over a planet. There is also an old version of the Galaxy logo in the corner. This thumbnail was last used in the end of Gamma phase. <File:ShipyardThumbnail001.png%7Cthumb>\|*\'Creator:*Unknown**\'\' - This image features a [Nimitz](Nimitz "wikilink"), various fighters, and a concept [Pirates](Pirates "wikilink") Boss ship in some kind of foggy environment.

Ships included are a [Prototype X-2](Prototype_X-2 "wikilink"), a [Decimator](Decimator "wikilink"), a [Punisher](Punisher "wikilink"), and a bunch of smaller ships. This image is currently used as the server banner for the [Galaxy Discord Server](https://galaxy.robloxgalaxy.wiki/).

# Galaxypedia Logos {#galaxypedia_logos}

This section contains images pulled from [1](https://robloxgalaxy.wiki/logos). These logos are used around the Galaxypedia and sometimes in game as well.

<File:Galaxy\*pfp\*2.png%7Cthumb>\|\*\*Creator: \_Unknown**\* - This image was originally used as a thumbnail for the game. It features the pilot of an unknown ship in the heat of battle, with explosions in the background. <File:Logo2.png%7Cthumb>\|**Creator: \_Unknown**\* - This is similar to the first image, but with \"WIKIA\" written in large text. It is currently used as the branding image for the Galaxypedia. <File:Galaxypediabanner.png%7Cthumb>\|**Creator: _Unknown_** - This picture shows a silhouette of a [Prototype X-1](Prototype_X-1 "wikilink") on a light gray background. Written in white text is \"GALAXYPEDIA\" \"THE NEW ERA OF THE GALAXY WIKI\". <File:Galaxypedialogo.png%7Cthumb>\|**Creator: \*Unknown**\'\' - This image is very similar to the previous one, with the same silhouette and the same text. However, the text and the background image are in different proportion and the entire image is scaled down. <File:Whydothistomemediawiki.png%7Cthumb>\|**Creator:\*Unknown\*\*\'\' - A scaled down and square version of the previous image, this was the logo for the now discontinued desktop version of the Galaxypedia. The file is named \"whydothistomemediawiki.ico\", indicating that when Sugondese, the creator of the application, was in the process of making it, he was having some issues with Mediawiki, which is the framework for the Galaxypedia.

# Videos

There are many content creators who focus on Galaxy, so they won\'t all be listed here. The game does have three officially endorsed videos however. One of these was used as a trailer to Galaxy\'s Gamma Phase. The other two are used as peaceful and combat trailers to the current Delta Phase.

**Galaxy Gamma Trailer: `<youtube>`{=html}<https://youtu.be/Z9eBu2VU3m4>`</youtube>`{=html}Creator: Robbie Couret**

This trailer features a large battle with many ships. The perspective changes a few times throughout the video. The battle results in the destruction of an unnamed [Subjugator](Subjugator "wikilink").

**Galaxy Delta Peaceful Trailer: `<youtube>`{=html}<https://youtu.be/8N29ZapVdm0>`</youtube>`{=html}Creator: MЯR**

This trailer begins with a shot of a [Tempura](Tempura "wikilink") warping to some unknown location. The video then begins to talk about mining, showing a few clips of mining in a [Tango](Tango "wikilink"), [Rorqual](Rorqual "wikilink"), [Orca](Orca "wikilink"), and [Galaxy](Galaxy "wikilink"). The next clip shown is that of a [Prepravca](Prepravca "wikilink") docking with the [Megabase](Mega_Base "wikilink"), and the player buying and selling a few items. The video ends with the player exploring [Myriad](Myriad "wikilink") and [Aqueous](Aqueous "wikilink"), both on foot and piloting a [Viper](Viper "wikilink").

**Galaxy Delta Combat Trailer: `<youtube>`{=html}<https://youtu.be/ZQdV-0eAQqE>`</youtube>`{=html}Creator: MЯR**

The video starts with a player joining a team, and a few cinematic shots of the [Prototype X-2](Prototype_X-2 "wikilink"). It then transitions to a clip of a battle in that ship, then in a [Zhen](Zhen "wikilink"), then a shot of the turrets on an [Astraeus](Astraeus "wikilink"). The video then moves onto a battle with a [Deity](Deity "wikilink"), which becomes the background for a showcase of various Build Menu screens. It then ends with a few more battles, involving a [Hyperion](Hyperion "wikilink"), a [Lucifer](Lucifer "wikilink"), and an [Armageddon](Armageddon "wikilink"). The trailer then ends with text that reads \"GALAXY\", overtop a video of an unknown ship destroying another unknown ship.
