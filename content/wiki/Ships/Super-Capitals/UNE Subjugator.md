_This article describes the NPC ship. For the player-owned equivalent, see [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator)._

The **UNE Subjugator** is an U.N.E. [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) and one of the largest AI ships in the game.

## Description

The **UNE Subjugator** is a passive, [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) affiliated ship that is the equivalent of a [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) and one of the tankiest ships in the game at a total health of 35000 and 65% damage resistance.

Only a maximum of 2 spawns in a public server.

## Behavior

It is seen and spawns at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) guarding it and It will attack [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) and [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) ships if they get too close. It is able to call other U.N.E. ships to assist it in combat, similar to a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher).

It will leave it's guarding post to respond to other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships' call for aid. Once the target is destroyed, it will return to [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).

**Note**: UNE Subjugator, along with all other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships do not spawn in private servers.

## Strategy

- Lure powerful enemy AI ships such as the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) or [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) to it, as the UNE Subjugator will always win the battle due to it being extremely tanky and having an allied fleet supporting it from its call ability.

<!-- -->

- Be sure to warp away as far as possible as when it's somehow destroyed, it will leave a **10k Stud nuke**, dealing tremendous amounts of damage to any ship close it.

## Version History

- Added in version 69f.
- Spawned naturally along with other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) capital ships during the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event) in version .75a10
- Disabled from spawning naturally due to the conclusion of the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event) in version .75a11

## Trivia

- Even though it has 2 [ShieldSide]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide), these never spawn unlike the player-owned [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator).

<!-- -->

- The largest passive AI Ship in the game.

- A wreck of it can be seen above the former Kneall Outpost during the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event).
