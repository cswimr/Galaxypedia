![Current Eradicator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Old-Eradicator.jpg-"Current-Eradicator") The **_Eradicator_** is an [**Alien**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations) AI ship and part of the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) Fleet. ![Recolored

## Description

The **Eradicator** is the most powerful ship ever in terms of sheer damage output and can easily tear though anything that dares oppose it. It also comes with extreme maneuverability and high damage resistance, both of which increase its threat level significantly. It shares some visual likeness with the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2) and is generally built in the style of an Alien ship, but with red and yellow coloring as opposed to the classic neon green.

It used to look like the Kneall prototype though.

## Behavior

The Eradicator is the NPC counterpart to the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2). It spawns in round 6 and 7 of the [Kneall Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold). It likely behaves similarly to other Alien ships, targeting ships that approach it within a certain range or those that actively target it first. Once locked onto a target, it will either maintain a steady distance or chase after a warping target, attacking it until the target is destroyed or becomes untargetable (either through despawning or safe docking).

It never stops firing if it's turrets have line of sight, since all turrets usually get recharged around 1 second of firing, meaning it is extremely hard to tank against.

The Eradicator constantly circles around its target, firing its spinals when somehow aligned against target.

Extremely lethal. Do not approach.

## Strategy

- Do not attempt any kind of head-on attack, even with the most powerful of [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) or [Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).
- Use small, fast, and maneuverable ships like the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper) or [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco) to draw its fire, then lure it to a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or a fleet of ships that can attack it while it is distracted.

If you see the eradicator looking at you, warp. It has decimating [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and is not worth tanking in even the most powerful [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships). Try to warp out as fast as you can as when the eradicators target you, usually the rest of the [aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}aliens) will do the same, and smaller [aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}aliens) will often warp to you,so you'll need some extra health to try and tank the swarm. This is also very helpful for the rest of your fleet as the eradicators will still be looking at you even if you are out of range ensuring that the player fleet can get a lot of damage off without having to worry about the Eradicator. Note that they won't look at you permanently, instead they'll looks at you for around 4 seconds.

## Loot

## Trivia

- Not much is known about the Eradicator aside from basic stats.

- When spawned, it appears with a [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) symbol, but enlarged to the scale of an X-0 map icon.

- The Eradicator appears to be a recolored [Kneall Prototype]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Prototype).

- An Eradicator was spawned on April Fools 2022. The server was shut down shortly afterwards.
