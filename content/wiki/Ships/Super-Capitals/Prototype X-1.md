The **_Prototype X-1_**is a [**Prototype**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes) created by the [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-Nations-of-Earth).

## Description

The **Prototype X-1** is an incredibly sturdy, sluggish, expensive, massive, and hard-hitting flagship. It is equipped with a unique [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) armament that allows the ship to deal a colossal amount of damage with a single volley. Its [Quest]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}quests) requires 50k [Silicate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 40k [Carbon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 30k [Iridium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Adamantite]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Palladium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Titanium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Quantium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Uranium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1 [Weapons Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Weapons-Part), 1 [Intact Bastion Module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Intact-Bastion-Module), and 15 million credits.

This ship was originally obtainable via quests from various places during the Beta phase of the game, however it is currently available as a Quest reward from the UNE requisitions officer located in the UNE.

The Prototype X-1 features the Bastion Mode [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}module), which severely reduces the ship's maximum speed but increases damage output by 20% and negates 35% of incoming damage (all damage taken is multiplied by 0.65). When activated, all neon lights on the ship turn red. The [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}module) can toggle the ship in and out of Bastion Mode. While in this state, the ship is unable to warp.

## Appearance

The **Prototype X-1** is notable for its unique appearance. To start with, there is the distinctive hammerhead-like shape it has at the front of its hull, and two engine pods mounted on both sides respectively near the rear of the ship hull. The engine array at the rear of the ship is large, with the engines themselves bearing resemblance to the [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon). The ship has mostly dark shades of colors (gray, black, etc.), with a neon blue/cyan trim around some of the plating on the ship hull. There is also neon tiling on the ship's bridge which seemingly spans from the front to about the mid-section of the ship.

The [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) the **Prototype X-1** are equipped with also have a unique appearance, with the Colossus turrets resembling the appearance of quadruple battleship cannon turret batteries; and also appearing to have [coincidence rangefinders]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:Coincidence-rangefinder). <s>The Bombardment Cannons have a unique appearance of their own as well with a similar style to the Colossus turrets, but much smaller in size and with only a single barrel.</s> (Note: The **Prototype X-1** is no longer equipped with Bombardment Cannons, and now is solely equipped with Colossus turrets.)

The interior of the ship is fairly large, having volumetric displays of ships and various other objects, as well as a map (or radar?) of the ship and its surroundings directly located below the bridge to the cockpit in the interior. The cockpit contains a seat behind two screens facing it (the left one having a keyboard mounted to it), and the seat itself has two joysticks on both armrests respectively; along with footrests. The interior also features two holographic flags, bearing the insignias of [Vanguard Coalition]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vanguard-Coalition) and [White Collar Society]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}White-Collar-Society) respectively.

## Advantages

- Large Cargo Hold.
- Many players will retreat just from seeing this spawned.
- Excellent at [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) bases from long range.
- Has 110,000 combined HP.
- Large explosion radius of 15,000 studs, which may wipe out ships unfortunate enough to get caught in the blast.
- Has high hull damage output and alpha damage with the unique Turrets.
- The Prototype X-1 no longer has any Bombardment Cannons and have been replaced by more Colossus Cannons and Lasers.
- Longer range compared to the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2).
- This ship's unique [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) allows the Prototype X-1 to effectively become the module's namesake, a bastion.

## Disadvantages

- Mediocre [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage output compared to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage output.
- Extremely slow and struggles to turn.
- Inaccurate Colossus Turrets makes fighting any ship that is considerably smaller or faster harder, on top of being unable to completely out-range bases.
- One of the most expensive ships in the game, costing a whopping 23.6 million to get this ship.
- The Weapon Part requires 32500 Uranium and 10 Armored Plating, which **WILL** take up a level 31 [warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}warehouse), not to mention the materials required will force you to have a level 38 warehouse. In addition to the warehouse costs, materials (regarding the most recent release) cost an estimated 3.6 million Credits,
- Spawning one makes you a very high priority target.
- A very large target which means Spinals can hit you easily.
- Can be swarmed by small ships, although the resulting damage can be (somewhat) mitigated by the new Bastion Module.
- While active, the ship's module incurs a **huge** movement penalty on the ship, and prevents [warping]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive), until the module is disabled. To complicate matters, it takes almost as long to disable the module as it takes to enable it, leaving you in a potentially sticky situation if not used wisely.

## Strategy

- Use support ships when in combat.
- **_NEVER_** travel alone on this ship.
- Despite the large Cargo Hold for a combat ship, you should not use this ship for trading during [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), as an experienced team could still take you down.
- It is recommended to avoid using this ship in public/populated servers if alone or unorganized, or very sparingly, as due to its rarity, expense, and status as a trophy kill. It is a _very_ valuable target, and many will go to great lengths to destroy it.
- To reiterate, this ship is extremely, extremely expensive. Use it wisely, and **trust no one**. Time and time again, long-lasting friendships have been destroyed by betrayals.
- Make use of the ship's Bastion Module during sieges, even if you are not tanking damage for your fleet, as your firepower while the module is active is improved in varying manners, including accuracy. However, always have an escape plan, and be prepared to disengage the module as soon as you see any signs that you may need to flee.
- If your team is having difficulty chasing down and destroying crippled enemy ships, loiter around the enemy's base/planet with your Bastion Module active (but be careful to not sustain too much damage). Eventually, your team should be able to deal enough damage to your target that they are forced to attempt to dock at their base, which is the perfect opportunity for you to finish them off.
  - If your enemy has multiple bases, try to reduce their despawn options by sieging weaker, poorly defended bases/planets with the Bastion Module active, and destroying/capturing them, if possible.

## Trivia

- The original ship model was put into the game with the old U.N.E flag decal on it. This was a mistake. You can still see this on the retro variant of this ship, the [Retro Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Prototype-X-1).
- The previous **Prototype X-1** model had arguably the most detailed interior of all the ships in Galaxy.
- This ship has the largest explosion size of any ship in the game (along with the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer) and [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak)), at 1500 explosion radius.
- The original **Prototype X-1** model looks similar to the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan) because its model was modified from the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan).
- Many people have lost this ship to welding and betrayal. This is one ship that you should never trust when with opposing large fleets of people.
- Had custom Torpedo models, in which were removed.
- Appears on the Galaxy Wikia Background
- Hacks allowed this ship to be force-built in version .69f14
- In mid beta, LordZeloxy and Cronotious conducted tests involving the Prototype X-1 and the ""Prototype X-2"" and which ship would come out on top in a battle. One test was purely DPS and the other was an actual battle, however these tests went to Zeloxy's head, and he later lost his ship. Since then, as of 7/31/2021 seehyadued52 and greenninja010 have done an updated battle.
- Was the most expensive ship in the game for a insanely long time, [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia)'s cost when it was added was **11 million credits**, which would be massively reduced to 2 million credits (now 1,128,520), which lead to this ship being the most expensive ship again, [Woolly Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Woolly-Mammoth) would finally end this ship's reign as the most expensive ship after a very long time (mainly due to the crazy high cost of the Class A Permit being 18.5M credits), and then [Freedom Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Galaxy) would take that title, this ship would eventually take that title back, and then lose the title to the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2). Now, the Prototype X-1 and Prototype X-2 hold the title for most expensive ships with the removal of permits.
- Highest health out of all non-NPC ships, excluding Admin Ships. However, the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator) has more overall HP if you consider usage of both of its auxiliary [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide). Despite this, [Bastion Mode]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) allows the ship to have more effective HP.
- Its previous model looked very similar to the Klingon Negh'var-class warships from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.
