## Main Info

The Abaddon was Lordmoneymonkey's special ship that was almost added into the game. This ship was fully working and was in the dev server for a time during early 2018, It was then accidentally discovered by players and lord tried to shrug it off as if it was nothing.

This caused players to start speculating that they were finally getting a Titan-Classed ship, but months went on and it was never added in the long run.

Its was only until version .65b that it was announced that sadly titan ships were never coming to the game and this ship was only a test ship to see if they would actually fit into the game.

## Description

Based on the pictures, the Abaddon had a huge arsenal and a hangar bay toward the rear of the ship. It was said to be believed that Titans would act like a carrier and a Super Capital, with both large amounts of damage and fighters that players could fly.
