The **_Deity_** is an extremely maneuverable [Super Capital Ship](:Category:Super_Capital_Ship "wikilink") that is extremely adept at brawling against other capital ships.

## Description

The **Deity** is an extremely large [Super Capital Ship](:Category:Super_Capital_Ship "wikilink"), but despite its size, it is fast and agile and capable of dishing out large amounts of damage, making it excellent for combat against other capital ships.

The Deity has a [module](Ship_Modules "wikilink") \"Adaptive Thrusters\"

## Appearance

The **Deity** is a mid-sized [Super Capital Ship](:Category:Super_Capital_Ship "wikilink") that has a similar shape to the [Oblivion](Oblivion "wikilink"), with an extremely long forked shape front. The ship contains many detailing similar to other ships in [Event Horizon](Event_Horizon "wikilink"), with striped platings that correspond to team color lining the ship. The back of the ship features many engines and a large ring at the middle. Despite the middle of the ship being hollow and similar to that of a large spinal barrel, the Deity does not use any sort of spinal whatsoever.

The Interior consists of two rooms, one is the bridge found in the middle of the ship, and one is the lounge, found at the bottom of the ship. The bridge consists of a large control center, with the pilot seat in the middle, along with an illustration of the ship. A meeting room is found with a large table and adjacent to it are the doors that lead outside the ship and the other leading to the lounge room. The lounge room is mainly made of glass, making it similar to an observatory, with a bar in the middle and seats on the front.

## Advantages

- Fantastic for PvP against other [Dreadnoughts](:Category:Dreadnought "wikilink"), [Carriers](:Category:Carrier "wikilink") and especially [Super Capitals](:Category:Super_Capital_Ship "wikilink").
- Has turn speed that is better than many [Battleships](:Category:Battleship "wikilink").
- Has the highest mobility and speed in its class.
- Turrets have good accuracy and extremely fast reload, allowing it to mow down enemy ships easily.
- Has high turret-based firepower.
- [Module](Ship_Modules "wikilink") changes top speed to 150 in exchange for lower turn speed.

## Disadvantages

- No [Turrets](Turrets "wikilink") underneath the ship, making it an easy target for swarms of smaller ships.
- Low hull damage output compared to shields.
- 2nd lowest total health out of any [Super Capital Ship](:Category:Super_Capital_Ship "wikilink"), only beaten by [Theia](Theia "wikilink").
- Rather low health and limited range makes it an inappropriate ship for sieging.
- Has difficulty hitting ships that are smaller than a [Battlecruiser](:Category:battlecruiser "wikilink").
- Like most large ships, it has a lot of surface area where it can be easily shot. This is somewhat balanced by the relatively high speed of this ship.

## Strategy

- It is not a good idea to siege with this ship because of its below average health and limited range.
- Never travel alone unless you are absolutely certain you will not lose it.
- If you are up against a [Super Capital Ship](:Category:Super_Capital_Ship "wikilink"), try to get under them and behind them so you can take it down while minimizing damage from their main, heavy-hitting Turrets.
- This ship is best used in a fleet, as providing cover for it can make it maximize it\'s potential, and lessens the chance of getting [dived](Galaxy_Slang "wikilink").
- Avoid attempting to engage multiple small ships at once. The ship is capable, but like many other ships in its class; it suffers from less than ideal accuracy on its turrets, and is highly vulnerable to swarming because of it.
- Keep large ships in your line of fire by taking advantage of your quick speed and good maneuverability.
- When fighting against large ships such as other [Super Capitals](:Category:Super_Capital_Ship "wikilink") or [Dreadnoughts](:Category:Dreadnought "wikilink"), take advantage of your superior mobility and warp underneath them.
- This ship is great at [diving](Galaxy_Terminology "wikilink"), so use that to your advantage.
